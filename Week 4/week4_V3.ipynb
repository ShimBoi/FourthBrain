this assignment, we will have a very small training set to work with. Additionally, the test set we'll use has very few features. We'll first expose you to an Auto-Machine Learning library called TPOT and show you how it can be used to search over many ML model architectures. Then we will use the Label Spreading method to do semi-supervised learning, allowing us to leverage a small amount of labeled data in combination with a larger amount of unlabeled data. Finally we'll have a more open-ended task centering on system design for Zero-shot learning\n","\n","### Labeled data is sparse, and in our hypothetical application, (cosmetics purchase prediction) the intention is to maximize Recall (so that no popular cosmetic is understocked).
